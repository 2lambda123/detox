While there\'s still a lot of place for improvement, the new Detox release refines their interaction and lays the groundwork for third-party integrations.\\n\\n[Mocha] was our first supported test runner, but unfortunately, it could not keep up with our scaling requirements as the number of end-to-end tests grew. [By the time][Mocha 8] it acquired the ability to run tests in parallel, we already had [to place bets][Jest PR] on another horse, and that was [Jest].\\n\\nWe attempted to keep compatibility with both Jest and Mocha, but the farther we went, the more obvious it was that we couldn\'t have it both ways. As it turned out, Jest wasn\'t easy to get along with \u2013 our first integration with it was too simplistic. Over a couple of years of use in production, we kept discovering various issues that forced us to rewrite our \\"glue\\" code from scratch twice, and this isn\'t over yet. All that combined didn\'t leave much time and energy for tinkering with Mocha anymore.\\n\\nAdmittedly, such new features as [test runner config][`Config file > Test runner`] and [Internals API][`Internals API`] came at expense of leaving behind our old Mocha integration, simply due to a shortage of resources. If there\'s enough demand, now it is up to the open-source community to build a new integration between Detox and Mocha.\\n\\n## Genymotion SaaS\\n\\nTwo years ago we [added a basic support][Genymotion PR] for cloud-based Android emulators provided by [Genymotion SaaS] and started a beta testing phase across mobile projects at Wix. After all the rigors of maintaining local emulators on CI build agents, those lightweight cloud devices felt like a breath of fresh air \u2013 full GPU acceleration, easy scaling and far less maintenance. For instance, teams with a large test codebase could reduce duration of their CI pipelines almost by half after scaling up from 2 devices to 6 per each build.\\n\\nThis positive impact encouraged us to adopt [Genymotion SaaS] as quickly as possible for all the relevant projects, in spite of system design flaws brought by the initial solution, especially in regard to the global lifecycle management. While those flaws were rather minor, we felt uncertain about releasing it as-is, and decided to take time and gain more production experience before taking any direction.\\n\\nThe further experience was rather smooth and rarely raised new issues, so about half a year ago we set ourselves to the goal to address the global test lifecycle concerns and open up the cloud device capability for the entire Detox community. To date, there are a few minor [glitches](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3573) that might occur in advanced use scenarios, but we\'ll address them soon as well, likely this year.\\n\\nNow more than ever, we feel a need to provide our users with more opportunities for testing in the cloud, and this step is only the first of many to come. We hope you\'ll utilize this new feature to your delight.\\n\\n## Configurable logger\\n\\n**Highlights**: [`Config file > Logger`], [`Logger API`].\\n\\nThe rigidity of the logging subsystem has been weighing on me ever [since I rewrote it][Logger rewrite] in the summer of 2019. Due to time constraints and existing tech debts, it was impossible to do it right the first time, so we lived about three years with rather a proof-of-concept than a full-fledged feature.\\n\\nThe inconvenience wasn\'t fatal but quite noticeable, nevertheless. Here are a few syndromes you could have spotted if you have ever used Detox timeline and log artifacts, especially when running tests in parallel:\\n\\n* an uncanny file array: `detox_pid_7505.log`, `detox_pid_7505.log.json`, `detox_pid_7506.log`;\\n* a relatively shallow `detox.trace.json`: test suites, test functions, and some user-defined segments.\\n\\nThe good news is that the new Detox release condenses all those numerous logs into two files:\\n\\n* the plain, human-readable `detox.log`;\\n* the raw, machine-readable `detox.trace.json` for [Perfetto], `chrome://trace`, and any other programs.\\n\\n![A screenshot of timeline view generated by Perfetto](/img/blog/v20-perfetto-example.png)\\n\\nWith the help of the new [Logger API][`Logger API`], you can add custom duration events to the timeline too, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\nawait detox.log.complete(\'Login\', async () => {\\n  await element(by.id(\'email\')).typeText(\'john@example.com\');\\n  await element(by.id(\'password\')).typeText(\'123456\');\\n  await element(by.id(\'submit\')).tap();\\n});\\n```\\n\\nBesides, it is possible now to customize the console output of Detox via the new [logger config][`Config file > Logger`], e.g.:\\n\\n```js title=\\"detox.config.js\\"\\n/** @type {Detox.DetoxConfig} */\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  // ...\\n  logger: {\\n    options: {\\n      showDate: false,\\n      showLoggerName: false,\\n      showPid: false,\\n      prefixers: {\\n        ph: null,\\n      },\\n    },\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this example we minimize all the metadata around the log messages \u2013 see the screenshot below:\\n\\n![Terser logs after applying the override](/img/blog/v20-logger-options.png)\\n\\n## Minor features\\n\\n### Headless iOS\\n\\nOne of long-standing inconveniences was that Detox has been booting iOS simulators in hidden window mode not only on CI,\\nbut in local development environment as well. We unified `headless` flag for both iOS and Android, so that both the\\nplatforms boot a device in a visible way unless you configure it otherwise, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\n/* @type {Detox.DetoxConfig} */\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  devices: {\\n    iphone: {\\n      type: \'ios.simulator\',\\n      // highlight-next-line\\n      headless: process.env.CI ? true : undefined,\\n      device: {\\n        type: \'iPhone 14\'\\n      },\\n      /* ... */\\n    }\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nor, via CLI:\\n\\n```bash\\ndetox test -c ios.sim.release --headless\\n```\\n\\n### Reverse ports\\n\\nYour apps might try to access some `localhost:*` addresses (e.g. mock servers), but this is a bit more problematic in case\\nof Android, because Android emulators are separate virtual devices, and they have their own loopback network interface.\\nIn such cases, you have to set up reverse port forwarding via `adb reverse`.\\n\\nSince this is a common scenario for apps in debug mode (e.g. React Native bundler on port 8081, Storybook server on 9009, etc.),\\nwe decided to add an optional config property for Android apps, `reversePorts`:\\n\\n```js\\n/** @type {Detox.DetoxConfig} */\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  // ...\\n  apps: {\\n    \'android.debug\': {\\n      type: \'android.apk\',\\n      binaryPath: \'...\',\\n      reversePorts: [3000],\\n    },\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nBasically, this is a convenience API which tells Detox to run `device.reverseTcpPort(portNumber)` after installing the\\napp. It should be useful for anyone who prefers keeps such things rather in configs than in the code.\\n\\n### Re-launching apps\\n\\nLong time ago we introduced `device.relaunchApp()` method. The method itself is identical to calling\\n`device.launchApp({ newInstance: true })`, so at some point we deprecated it... for no good reason. We often see\\npeople using `device.launchApp(opts)`, optional parameters, only to pass `{ newInstance: true }`, and that made us change our minds.\\n\\nWe added officially the convenience method to the [device API][`Device API > relaunchApp`] docs and [to the typings][typings], so feel free to use it:\\n\\n```js\\nawait device.relaunchApp();\\nawait device.relaunchApp(opts);\\n```\\n\\n### Read-only emulators by default\\n\\nThe `-read-only` flag appeared in [Android emulator 28.0.16](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/emulator#concurrent-avd), and we adopted it relatively quickly to Detox since it allowed to run multiple instances of a single Android virtual device (AVD) concurrently. Obviously, that helped to implement parallel test execution support for Android back then.\\n\\nBeing overcautious, we implemented that partially, only when user starts multiple concurrent workers, and this, in fact, created a common UX issue. Imagine you run tests in band, using one worker only. By default, that creates you a regular AVD instance, i.e. not a read-only one. After that you switch to multiple workers, and you get an error from Android emulator which complains about mixing regular and read-only instances. While the fix itself is very simple \u2013 close the running AVD and try again \u2013 this entire overcaution was rather creating issues than solving them.\\n\\nThis is why, from now on, Android emulators will always be starting in `-read-only` mode unless you configure `readonly: false` in your [device config][`Config file > Device`].\\n\\n### Reset lock file\\n\\nThis release adds a small CLI tool, [`detox reset-lock-file`][reset-lock-file], to help users with one specific use scenario.\\n\\nImagine you want to run tests for multiple Detox configurations at once, e.g.:\\n\\n```bash\\ndetox test -c iphoneSE2020.release e2e/ui.test.js\\ndetox test -c iphone14ProMax.release e2e/ui.test.js\\n```\\n\\nThe problem is that Detox uses a file locking mechanism to avoid situations when parallel test workers would take control over the same device. Starting `detox test` command resets that file contents, so it creates a risk of race condition.\\n\\nTo eliminate that risk, use combination of `detox reset-lock-file` and `--keepLockFile` like this:\\n\\n```bash\\ndetox reset-lock-file & \\\\\\ndetox test --keepLockFile -c iphoneSE2020.release e2e/ui.test.js & \\\\\\ndetox test --keepLockFile -c iphone14ProMax.release e2e/ui.test.js & \\\\\\nwait\\n```\\n\\n## Deprecations\\n\\nDetox 20 executes many pending deprecations, so make sure to check out our [Migration Guide] before upgrading:\\n\\n* JS: minimum supported Node.js version is `14.x`;\\n* JS: minimum supported Jest version is `27.2.5`;\\n* JS: Mocha test runner is no longer supported;\\n* JS: discontinued old adapters for Jest (`jest-jasmine`, first generation of `jest-circus` adapter);\\n* JS: discontinued `{ permanent: true }` option in `device.appLaunchArgs.*` methods ([#3360](https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/3360));\\n* Config: discontinued kebab-case properties: `test-runner`, `runner-config` ([#3371](https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/3371))\\n* Config: discontinued `skipLegacyWorkersInjections` property ([(#3286)](https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/3286))\\n* Config: deprecated `specs` and `runnerConfig` properties\\n* Config: changed [semantics][`Config file > Test runner`] of `testRunner` property\\n* Config: dropped support for all-in-one configurations ([#3386](https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/3386));\\n* Android: remove deprecated native IdlePolicyConfig ([#3332](https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/3332/files))\\n* iOS: discontinued `ios.none` device type ([#3361](https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/3361))\\n\\n## Afterword\\n\\nOver the last year and a half, we have been establishing a centralized configuration system for more than 50 projects using Detox at Wix. While it never seemed to be a cakewalk, the entire experience of troubleshooting over a hundred issues across the organization did not leave us unchanged.\\n\\nWe clearly see there are numerous things to improve in Detox, but most of them boil down to the same thing \u2013 **scaling**. Surprisingly, \\"scaling\\" makes an excellent umbrella term for nearly every challenge we\'ve been encountering lately:\\n\\n* _scaling up the users count_ requires us to improve the onboarding and troubleshooting experience;\\n* _scaling up the projects count_ forces us to centralize scattered configs into flexible organization presets;\\n* _scaling up the tests count_ prompts us to optimize the codebase and incline it towards cloud and remote execution.\\n\\nOur core team has been challenged with human resource constraints and scaling needs for a long time already, and, in many ways, that has shaped a specific mindset within our core team, where every feature is evaluated via asking a simple question: _is it going to save us and other people time to focus on more important things?_ Teaching how to fish is better than giving a fish, and our success at preventing support issues is more valuable than our success at solving them ourselves.\\n\\nThis is why we\'ll be making the next efforts in these three areas, with the hope to get back to you soon with even more exciting updates.\\n\\nEnjoy your drive with Detox 20!\\n\\nCheers! :wave:\\n\\n[`Config file > Test runner`]: /docs/next/config/testRunner\\n[`Internals API`]: /docs/next/api/internals\\n[`Dropping Mocha support`]: https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3193\\n[`Config file > Device`]: /docs/next/config/devices\\n[`Config file > Logger`]: /docs/next/config/logger\\n[`Config file > Test runner`]: /docs/next/config/testRunner\\n[`Device API > relaunchApp`]: /docs/next/api/device#devicerelaunchappparams\\n[`Logger API`]: /docs/next/api/logger\\n[reset-lock-file]: /docs/next/cli/reset-lock-file\\n[Jest]: https://jestjs.io\\n[Mocha]: https://mochajs.org\\n[Mocha 8]: https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/releases/tag/v8.0.0\\n[Jest PR]: https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/609\\n[Logger rewrite]: https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/835\\n[Genymotion PR]: https://github.com/wix/Detox/pull/2446\\n[Genymotion SaaS]: https://cloud.geny.io\\n[Genymotion issues]: https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3573\\n[Perfetto]: https://ui.perfetto.dev/\\n[Migration Guide]: /docs/next/guide/migration#200\\n[typings]: https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/next/detox/index.d.ts"}]}')}}]);

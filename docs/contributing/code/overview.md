# Contribute to Our Codebase

### Expectations and guidelines for contributors

As a contributor, we expect you to be familiar with the project's goals and code of conduct. Before making a contribution, please check the project's existing issues and make sure that your contributions include test coverage and are well-documented. Also, ensure that your code is compatible with the project's supported platforms and their supported versions.

Our workflow includes creating an issue for a new feature or bug report, opening a pull request with a proposed solution, and review from a collaborator. However, having a secondary code review from other contributors is highly desirable and encouraged. After review, a collaborator will merge the contribution and it will be released in the next version (usually). We use GitHub for pull requests, code review, and issue tracking.

Please keep in mind that all contributions should pass the code review process before being merged. This ensures the quality of our codebase. We expect you to be willing to communicate and responsive to feedback, and to work with the community to improve the project.
